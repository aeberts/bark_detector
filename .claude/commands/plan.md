Please help me plan the implementation of task: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this planning workflow:

**Assign Unique IDs**
- In @docs/backlog.md assign unique IDs to any tasks marked with `?` (e.g., `I?` â†’ `I5` or `I??` -> `I6`)

**Task Analysis**
- Review the CLAUDE.md file to understand the current planning workflow and project context
- Review the task overview from @docs/backlog.md for the specified task ID
- Review the @docs/features.md file for any existing feature specifications for the task

**Technical Planning**
- Break down the task into specific implementation steps
- Identify any dependencies on existing code or other tasks
- Consider potential edge cases and error handling
- Suggest the files that will need to be created or modified

**Implementation Strategy**
- Propose the order of implementation steps
- Highlight any architectural decisions that need to be made

**Next Actions**
- Ask the user for feedback before proceeding

Please be concise but actionable. Focus on creating a clear roadmap that can guide the actual implementation work.
