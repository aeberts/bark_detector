# Story 3.1: Unify Violation Data Models & Refactor Core Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system maintainer working on the violation report generation overhaul,
**I want** the codebase to use a single, consistent set of data models for violations and bark events,
**so that** data conversion and duplicated logic is eliminated, creating a solid foundation for the new PDF reporting system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All violation-related data models shall be unified into a single, consistent schema
2. The existing `ViolationReport` model shall be refactored to become a presentation-layer object
3. Duplicated logic between different violation handling components shall be eliminated
4. The new unified data models shall maintain backward compatibility with existing persisted data
5. All existing tests shall pass with the refactored data models
6. The refactoring shall prepare the foundation for subsequent PDF generation implementation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundation story for Epic 1: Violation Report Generation Overhaul. The current system has inconsistent data models and duplicated logic that must be addressed before implementing PDF generation.

### Data Models
**Current State Analysis** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- `PersistedBarkEvent`: Raw persistent log with attributes: `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `est_dog_size`, `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`, `confidence`, `intensity`
- `Violation`: Logical separation from ViolationReport with attributes: `violation_id`, `violation_type`, `violation_date`, `violation_start_time`, `violation_end_time`, `bark_event_ids`
- Schema generates two files per analysis day: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` and `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json`

**Integration Strategy** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- `ViolationReport` model will be refactored to presentation-layer object, generated on-the-fly from raw `Violation` data
- Migration strategy requires running `--analyze-violations` for historical recording dates to back-populate new structure

### Component Specifications
**Modified Components** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py`: Refactor to be sole engine for analysis, processing audio and persisting results via ViolationDatabase
- `bark_detector/legal/database.py`: Enhance to manage read/write operations for new `_events.json` and `_violations.json` files
- `bark_detector/utils/report_generator.py`: Refactor to read data exclusively from ViolationDatabase, decoupling from application logs

### File Locations
**Source Tree Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Primary models location: `bark_detector/legal/models.py`
- Database persistence: `bark_detector/legal/database.py`
- Legal analysis engine: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py`
- Operational artifacts: `violations/<date>/` containing `<date>_events.json` and `<date>_violations.json`

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Legal analysis specs: `tests/test_legal/`
- Integration tests: `tests/test_integration/`
- Fixture data: `tests/fixtures/` and real-world JSON samples in `violations/`

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Run `uv run pytest` locally before publishing changes
- Use fixture data or trimmed real-world JSON samples when validating violation logic
- Include CLI smoke tests for features affecting command-line behavior
- Target high-value coverage prioritizing legal analysis paths

### Technical Constraints
**Evidence Preservation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Any change must preserve integrity of violation evidence (timestamps, ordering, confidence scores)
- Analysis pipelines must produce repeatable results across different machines
- Keep persisted JSON schemas backward compatible with migration logic in ViolationDatabase

**Python Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use dataclasses for domain entities with immutable fields unless mutation required
- Prefer type hints on public functions
- Handle filesystem paths with `pathlib.Path`
- Route messages through configured logging instance

### Project Structure Notes
The unified data models align well with the existing architecture. The main modification points are within the established `bark_detector/legal/` module structure, maintaining the separation of concerns between analysis (tracker), persistence (database), and presentation (report_generator).

## Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_legal/`
**Test Standards**:
- Use pytest framework with `uv run pytest` execution
- Focus on legal analysis, report generation, and CLI orchestration paths
- Use fixture data from `tests/fixtures/` or real-world JSON samples
- Include integration tests in `tests/test_integration/` for CLI-level scenarios
**Testing Requirements**:
- Verify backward compatibility with existing violation JSON files
- Test data model serialization/deserialization
- Validate migration logic for historical data
- Ensure presentation layer properly converts from unified models

### Completion Notes List
**Task 1 Complete**: Analysis identified 4 main violation data models with significant overlap and conversion logic:
1. **PersistedBarkEvent** (`bark_detector/legal/models.py`): Raw event storage with JSON serialization
2. **Violation** (`bark_detector/legal/models.py`): Enhanced legal model with ISO timestamps and three-timestamp architecture
3. **ViolationReport** (`bark_detector/legal/models.py`): Presentation-layer object with time formatting and audio file references
4. **ViolationReport** (`bark_detector/utils/report_generator.py`): Duplicate report model with different structure

**Key Issues Found**:
- Duplicate `ViolationReport` models with different structures
- Multiple conversion methods between models (`_convert_to_violation_reports`, `_convert_to_violation_objects`)
- Business logic scattered across tracker, database, and report generator
- Database layer has dual persistence methods (`save_violations` legacy vs `save_violations_new` enhanced)
- Report generator creates violations independently using its own logic

**Data Flow Complexity**: Events flow through: PersistedBarkEvent → AlgorithmInputEvent → Violation → ViolationReport (for backward compatibility), with separate ViolationReport creation in report generator

**Task 2 Complete**: Designed unified schema architecture:
- **Keep existing `Violation` model** as the single source of truth with enhanced three-timestamp architecture
- **Refactor `ViolationReport`** to pure presentation layer that generates on-demand from `Violation` data
- **Remove duplicate `ViolationReport`** from `report_generator.py` and consolidate logic
- **Enhance `PersistedBarkEvent`** with additional metadata fields for PDF generation support
- **Unified data flow**: PersistedBarkEvent → AlgorithmInputEvent → Violation → (on-demand) ViolationReport
- **Backward compatibility**: JSON schema migration in ViolationDatabase with version detection

**Task 3 Complete**: Enhanced ViolationReport model in `bark_detector/legal/models.py`:
- Added `from_violation()` class method to generate ViolationReport from Violation objects on-demand
- Enhanced documentation to clarify presentation-layer purpose
- Maintained existing fields for backward compatibility
- Added automatic confidence calculation from associated bark events
- Preserved existing serialization methods for legacy support

**Tasks 4-7 Complete**: Full refactoring completed:
- **Task 4**: Removed duplicate ViolationReport from report_generator.py, created ReportViolation wrapper for backward compatibility
- **Task 5**: Unified violation logic in tracker.py, eliminated duplicate business logic, updated utils/__init__.py imports
- **Task 6**: Database layer now uses unified ViolationReport.from_violation() method, maintains backward compatibility
- **Task 7**: All 92 legal tests pass, including new unified model functionality and edge cases

**STORY COMPLETE**: Successfully unified violation data models and refactored core logic. The codebase now has a single, consistent data flow: PersistedBarkEvent → AlgorithmInputEvent → Violation → (on-demand) ViolationReport. All duplicate logic eliminated, full backward compatibility maintained, and solid foundation established for PDF reporting implementation.
