# Story 1.3: Update the `--analyze-violations` Command

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to run the `--analyze-violations` command,
**so that** it uses the refactored `LegalViolationTracker` to generate accurate, persisted analysis files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Running `uv run python -m bark_detector --analyze-violations [DATE]` executes the new analysis workflow.
2. The correct `_events.json` and `_violations.json` files are created in the `violations/[DATE]/` directory.
3. **The `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are updated to reflect the changes to this command.**

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Fix Filename Format Inconsistency** (AC: 2)
  - [x] **PRIMARY**: Update `ViolationDatabase._get_violations_file_path()` in `bark_detector/legal/database.py` line 69
  - [x] Change `f"{date}-violations.json"` → `f"{date}_violations.json"` (dash to underscore)
  - [x] Run existing unit tests to ensure no regressions in ViolationDatabase functionality
  - [x] Verify both files now use consistent underscore format: `YYYY-MM-DD_events.json` and `YYYY-MM-DD_violations.json`
  - [x] Test file creation with corrected naming to ensure proper JSON file generation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.2 completion notes]
- LegalViolationTracker has been successfully refactored to use new ViolationDatabase methods (save_events, save_violations_new)
- PersistedBarkEvent and Violation models are implemented with full JSON serialization/deserialization
- Date-partitioned directory structure automatically creates `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` folders
- All tests passing (14/14) for the refactored violation analysis engine
- CLI integration verified to work correctly through existing --analyze-violations command

### 🚨 CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED - NOW TASK 1 PRIORITY
[Code review findings]
**Filename Format Inconsistency**: The current `ViolationDatabase._get_violations_file_path()` method uses DASH format (`{date}-violations.json`) but all documentation specifies UNDERSCORE format (`{date}_violations.json`).
- **Current Code**: `{date}-violations.json` ❌
- **Expected**: `{date}_violations.json` ✅ (to match events file pattern)
- **Location**: `bark_detector/legal/database.py` line 69
- **Impact**: This inconsistency will cause issues with any reporting code that expects consistent underscore naming
- **Solution**: One-character change from dash to underscore in f-string
- **Risk Level**: LOW (simple change) but HIGH impact if not fixed
- **Dependencies**: MUST be fixed before CLI integration testing to ensure accurate verification

### API Integration Strategy
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#modified-cli-commands]
- **`--analyze-violations [DATE]`**: Primary data-generation tool performing deep analysis and populating JSON files
- **Current Implementation**: CLI delegates to `AdvancedBarkDetector.analyze_violations_for_date()` which calls `LegalViolationTracker.analyze_recordings_for_date()`
- **Expected Behavior**: Command should now create two JSON files per analysis run using the refactored persistence layer

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#modified-components]
- **CLI Layer**: `bark_detector/cli.py` - handles command parsing and user interaction
- **Detection Layer**: `bark_detector/core/detector.py` - `AdvancedBarkDetector.analyze_violations_for_date()` method
- **Analysis Engine**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` - `LegalViolationTracker` (already refactored in Story 1.2)
- **Persistence Layer**: `bark_detector/legal/database.py` - `ViolationDatabase` (already enhanced in Story 1.1)

### Data Flow Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#component-interaction-diagram]
```
User → CLI → AdvancedBarkDetector → LegalViolationTracker → ViolationDatabase → JSON Files
```

### File Locations
[Source: Current project structure analysis]
- **CLI Implementation**: `bark_detector/cli.py` lines 350-367 (current --analyze-violations handler)
- **Detector Integration**: `bark_detector/core/detector.py` lines 688-699 (`analyze_violations_for_date` method)
- **Analysis Engine**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` (already refactored with new persistence)
- **🚨 BUG FIX REQUIRED**: `bark_detector/legal/database.py` line 69 - `_get_violations_file_path()` method
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_cli.py` (for CLI integration testing)

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#new-data-models]
- **PersistedBarkEvent**: Raw bark detection events saved to `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json`
- **Violation**: Legal violation analysis results saved to `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json`
- **Directory Structure**: `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` automatically created by ViolationDatabase

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Language**: Python 3.11.4 - no version changes required
- **Package Manager**: Must use `uv run ...` for all commands
- **CLI Framework**: argparse (existing) - no framework changes needed
- **Error Handling**: Must maintain existing error handling patterns and user feedback

### Current CLI Implementation Analysis
[Source: Existing codebase review - bark_detector/cli.py:350-367]
- **Current Flow**: CLI → `detector.analyze_violations_for_date(args.analyze_violations)` → returns ViolationReport list
- **Expected Change**: The method should now also create JSON files via the refactored LegalViolationTracker
- **User Feedback**: CLI currently displays violation summaries - this should be maintained
- **Error Handling**: Current try/catch structure should be preserved

### Integration Verification Requirements
[Source: Epic requirements]
- **AC Verification**: Command must handle cases where recordings directory for given date doesn't exist
- **File Output**: Must verify `_events.json` and `_violations.json` files are actually created
- **Data Accuracy**: Files should contain accurate data matching the schema definitions

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Framework**: pytest, pytest-mock >=7.0.0
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_cli.py` for CLI integration testing
- **Pattern**: Add new test methods to existing CLI test file
- **Integration Requirement**: Tests must validate both CLI behavior and file creation
- **Coverage**: CLI integration, error handling, file validation, schema compliance

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test `--analyze-violations` command with valid date produces correct JSON files
- Test error handling when recordings directory doesn't exist for specified date
- Test file creation in correct `violations/[DATE]/` directory structure
- Test JSON file schema compliance with PersistedBarkEvent and Violation models
- Test CLI user feedback and logging during analysis process
- Test integration between CLI, detector, tracker, and database layers
