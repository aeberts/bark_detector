# Story 3.4: Enhanced Bark Activity Chart Visualization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system user investigating noise violations,
**I want** an enhanced Bark Activity Chart that shows comprehensive bark activity from 6am to 8pm with color-coded bark events,
**so that** I can visualize the full extent of daily bark activity beyond just violations to better understand barking patterns and evidence context.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The x-axis time scale of the Bark Activity Chart must start at 06:00am and end at 20:00pm (14-hour window)
2. All bark events from the day must be displayed on the timeline with appropriate color coding:
   - Red: Bark events that are part of constant (continuous) violations
   - Orange: Bark events that are part of intermittent violations
   - Gray: All other bark events (standalone barks not part of any violation)
3. The chart must replace existing violation bars with vertical lines and add individual bark event representation as vertical lines
4. The chart must preserve existing PDF generation performance and quality
5. The enhanced chart must display accurately for dates with varying amounts of bark activity (from few events to high-activity days)
6. All existing chart functionality (title, legend, axis labels) must be preserved and enhanced appropriately

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Modify _generate_activity_timeline method to implement 6am-8pm time window (AC: 1)

  - [x] Replace existing violation bars with appropriately scaled vertical lines
  - [x] Add individual bark event vertical lines to show all bark activity
  - [x] Scale line width appropriately to fit the 14-hour time window visualization

  - [x] Adjust chart layout if needed to accommodate additional visual elements
- [x] Task 4: Write comprehensive tests (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Unit tests for bark event categorization logic
  - [x] Unit tests for 6am-8pm time window rendering with vertical lines
  - [x] Integration tests with various bark activity scenarios (low, medium, high activity)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 completion notes: PDF generation service is successfully integrated with CLI. The _generate_activity_timeline method currently creates 24-hour bar charts showing violation intensity by hour. This story replaces the bar chart approach with vertical lines and enhances functionality to show individual bark events.

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
- **PersistedBarkEvent**: Contains `bark_id`, `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `confidence`, `intensity`, `audio_file_name` attributes needed for individual event visualization
- **Violation**: Contains `barkEventIds` array that maps to `bark_id` values in PersistedBarkEvent, used for color-coding bark events by violation association
- **Violation.type**: Values are "Continuous" (constant violations, red) or "Intermittent" (orange)

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **File Location**: `bark_detector/utils/pdf_generator.py` - Shared utilities for report generation
- **Method to Modify**: `_generate_activity_timeline()` method within PDFGenerationService class
- **Current Implementation**: Creates hourly bar chart with matplotlib, needs to be converted to vertical line visualization
- **New Implementation**: Vertical lines representing individual bark events and violations, scaled appropriately for 6am-8pm window
- **Dependencies**: matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.dates, ReportLab Image, datetime handling

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Evidence Integrity**: Must preserve timestamps and confidence scores in visualization accuracy
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Chart generation must produce consistent results across different machines
- **Performance**: Chart generation must not significantly impact PDF creation time
- **Type Hints**: Use proper type hints for new parameters and return values
- **Logging**: Route error messages through configured logging instance, avoid bare print statements

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: pytest with `pytest-mock` and `pytest-cov`
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_utils/test_pdf_generator.py` for unit tests
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_integration/test_pdf_integration.py` for integration scenarios
- **Execution Command**: `uv run pytest tests/`
- **Coverage Focus**: Chart generation logic, bark event categorization, time window handling
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock matplotlib for unit tests, use real generation for integration tests
- **Fixtures**: Use real-world bark event and violation data from `violations/` directory when available

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Test bark event categorization with mixed violation types (red/orange/gray lines)
- Test time window rendering accuracy (6am-8pm bounds) with vertical line placement
- Test chart readability with varying bark event densities using vertical line visualization
- Test line width and styling optimization for visual clarity
- Test performance impact on PDF generation workflow with vertical line rendering
- Test edge cases: no bark events, all events in violations, no violations but many bark events

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Primary Implementation**: `bark_detector/utils/pdf_generator.py`
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_utils/test_pdf_generator.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/test_integration/test_pdf_integration.py`
- **Generated Output**: `reports/` directory for PDF files
