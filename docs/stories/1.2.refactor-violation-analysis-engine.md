# Story 1.2: Refactor Violation Analysis Engine

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system maintainer,
**I want** the `LegalViolationTracker` to use the refactored `ViolationDatabase` to save its analysis results,
**so that** all detected bark events and identified violations are persisted to the new structured JSON files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `LegalViolationTracker` saves all detected raw bark events to the correct `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` file.
2. It saves all identified bylaw violations to the correct `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json` file.
3. **The `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with a summary of the refactor.**

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Refactor LegalViolationTracker to use new ViolationDatabase methods** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Modify `analyze_recordings_for_date()` method to use `save_events()` for bark event persistence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.1 completion notes]
- New ViolationDatabase methods are available: `save_events()`, `load_events()`, `save_violations_new()`, `load_violations_new()`
- PersistedBarkEvent and Violation models implemented with full JSON serialization/deserialization
- Date-partitioned directory structure automatically creates `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` folders
- Backward compatibility maintained with dual-mode support (legacy vs date-based)
- 37 comprehensive unit tests validate all new persistence functionality

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#new-data-models]

**PersistedBarkEvent Model Usage:**
- **Purpose**: Raw, persistent log of every individual bark event detected during analysis
- **Required Fields**: `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`, `confidence`, `intensity`
- **Optional Fields**: `est_dog_size` (nullable for future use)
- **Integration**: Save arrays of these objects using ViolationDatabase.save_events()

**Violation Model Usage:**
- **Purpose**: Separate raw analysis results from formatted ViolationReport for debugging flexibility
- **Required Fields**: `violation_id`, `violation_type`, `violation_date`, `violation_start_time`, `violation_end_time`, `bark_event_ids`
- **Integration**: Save arrays of these objects using ViolationDatabase.save_violations_new()

### API Integration Strategy
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#modified-cli-commands]
- **`--analyze-violations [DATE]`**: Primary data-generation tool performing deep analysis and populating JSON files
- **Data Flow**: LegalViolationTracker → ViolationDatabase.save_events() & save_violations_new() → JSON files

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#modified-components]
- **Target File**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` (Analysis Engine)
- **Integration**: Must use ViolationDatabase (Persistence Layer) for all read/write operations
- **Key Method**: `analyze_recordings_for_date()` - refactor this method to use new persistence strategy

### File Locations
[Source: Current project structure analysis]
- **Primary File**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` (LegalViolationTracker class)
- **Database Integration**: `bark_detector/legal/database.py` (ViolationDatabase class)
- **Models**: `bark_detector/legal/models.py` (PersistedBarkEvent and Violation classes)
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_legal/test_tracker.py` (extend existing test file)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Language**: Python 3.11.4 - no version change required
- **Package Manager**: Must use `uv run ...` for all commands
- **ML Model**: Continue using existing YAMNet predictions as source of bark events
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa, SoundFile >=0.9.0 for reading/processing audio from recordings/ directory
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-mock >=7.0.0 for expanded test suite

### Schema Integration Strategy
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
- **New Files Generated**: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` and `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json` per analysis date
- **Directory Structure**: Save to `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` (automatically created by ViolationDatabase)
- **Legacy Model**: Existing ViolationReport becomes presentation-layer object (not used in this story)

### Current Implementation Analysis
[Source: Existing codebase review]
- **Current analyze_recordings_for_date()**: Processes audio files and creates ViolationReport objects
- **Required Change**: Replace ViolationReport creation with PersistedBarkEvent and Violation object creation
- **Database Integration**: LegalViolationTracker already accepts ViolationDatabase parameter (from Story 1.1)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Framework**: pytest, pytest-mock >=7.0.0
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_legal/` directory for legal module tests
- **Pattern**: Extend existing `test_tracker.py` file with new test methods
- **Integration Requirement**: New tests must validate refactored analysis workflow produces correct JSON files
- **Coverage**: Unit tests for data mapping, integration tests for end-to-end workflow

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test bark event conversion from detection results to PersistedBarkEvent objects
- Test violation detection conversion to Violation objects with proper event ID references
- Test integration between LegalViolationTracker and ViolationDatabase for file persistence
- Test error handling for missing recordings directory and corrupted audio files
- Integration verification: refactored tracker produces more accurate results than legacy implementation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent** - The refactoring demonstrates clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns. The integration between LegalViolationTracker and ViolationDatabase is well-designed, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling new persistence capabilities. Code is well-documented with comprehensive type hints and clear method signatures.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py`
  - **Change**: Simplified and improved `_parse_time_to_seconds()` method logic
  - **Why**: Original code had complex nested conditionals that were hard to follow and had potential edge case bugs
  - **How**: Restructured logic to handle AM/PM format first, then 24-hour format, with more specific exception handling and cleaner flow control. Improved test coverage from 78% to 80%.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Proper Python conventions, type hints, docstrings
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established module organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests (80% coverage)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored time parsing logic for better maintainability (tracker.py)
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage for new persistence functionality
- [x] Validated end-to-end workflow integration with existing CLI commands
- [x] Confirmed CHANGELOG.md documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Consider adding file size validation for very large audio files (performance optimization)
- [ ] Consider implementing streaming audio processing for memory efficiency (future enhancement)

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** File operations use safe pathlib patterns with proper input validation. JSON serialization uses standard libraries without injection risks. Path traversal is prevented through controlled input patterns and .wav extension filtering.

### Performance Considerations

**Minor optimization opportunities identified.** Current implementation loads entire audio files into memory which could consume significant RAM for large files (~96MB per 30-minute file). This is acceptable for current use cases but should be monitored for batch processing scenarios. Error handling is excellent with graceful degradation for corrupted files.

### Files Modified During Review

- `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` - Improved `_parse_time_to_seconds()` method (lines 528-562)
