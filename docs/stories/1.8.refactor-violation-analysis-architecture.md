# User Story 1.8: Hybrid Violation Analysis Architecture Refactor

## Status
Done

## Story Format
**As a** bark detector system developer
**I want** to implement a hybrid violation analysis architecture that removes sessions from violation detection while preserving them for recording management
**So that** violation analysis becomes simpler, timestamp bugs are eliminated, and the system maintains reliable legal evidence collection while preserving existing recording and statistics features

## Problem Statement
Current violation analysis system has timestamp bugs due to session-based architecture complexity:
- Double-grouping: Events→Sessions→Sporadic Session Groups creates conversion errors
- Timestamp conversion issues between relative (session) and absolute (violation) timestamps
- 25 lines of unnecessary session management code in violation analysis
- Complex session metadata propagation causing correlation errors

## Proposed Solution
Implement Hybrid Approach B architecture:
- **Preserve BarkingSession**: Keep for recording file management and real-time statistics (10s gaps)
- **Direct Violation Analysis**: Analyze violations directly from bark events using absolute timestamps
- **Maintain APIs**: Preserve existing interfaces to minimize breaking changes
- **Gap Threshold Implementation**: Apply violation detection rules directly to events without session intermediation

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Direct Event-to-Violation Analysis
**Given** a collection of bark events from audio analysis
**When** violation analysis is performed
**Then** the system analyzes violations directly from bark events without creating intermediate sessions

### AC2: Continuous Violation Detection
**Given** bark events with gaps ≤60 seconds (configurable)
**When** the total barking duration ≥5 minutes
**Then** the system detects a "Constant" violation with accurate absolute timestamps

### AC3: Sporadic Violation Detection
**Given** bark events grouped by ≤5-minute gaps according to project_overview.md rules
**When** the total barking duration across groups ≥15 minutes
**Then** the system detects an "Intermittent" violation with correct time boundaries

### AC4: Preserved Recording Session Management
**Given** real-time bark detection during monitoring
**When** barking events occur with ≤10-second gaps
**Then** BarkingSession objects are created for recording management and statistics display

### AC5: Absolute Timestamp Preservation
**Given** violation analysis using direct event processing
**When** violations are detected and reported
**Then** all timestamps remain in absolute format without relative-to-absolute conversion errors

### AC6: Backward Compatibility Maintenance
**Given** existing CLI commands (--analyze-violations, --violation-report)
**When** the refactored system is used
**Then** all external APIs produce identical results with improved timestamp accuracy

### AC7: Test Suite Compatibility
**Given** the refactored violation analysis architecture
**When** all existing tests are run
**Then** test suite passes with minimal updates to mock session creation

### AC8: Performance Improvement
**Given** the simplified violation analysis pipeline
**When** analyzing recordings for violations
**Then** processing is ≥10% faster due to eliminated session conversion overhead
