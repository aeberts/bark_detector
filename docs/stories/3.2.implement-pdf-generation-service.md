# Story 3.2: Implement PDF Generation Service

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** legal evidence specialist working with the violation report generation system,
**I want** a new service that takes Violation objects and generates professional multi-page PDF reports with summary and detail pages including visual bark intensity graphs,
**so that** I can produce legally-compliant PDF violation reports that are professional, detailed, and ready for submission to municipal authorities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a new PDF generation service that accepts a list of `Violation` objects as input
2. Generate a professional multi-page PDF report containing both summary and detail pages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully unified violation data models, creating a single source of truth with the `Violation` model and presentation-layer `ViolationReport`. The PDF generation service will consume the unified `Violation` objects directly, eliminating the need for data conversion and leveraging the clean data architecture.

### Data Models
**Unified Violation Model** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- `Violation`: Primary data model with attributes: `violation_id`, `violation_type`, `violation_date`, `violation_start_time`, `violation_end_time`, `bark_event_ids`
- `PersistedBarkEvent`: Raw event data with attributes: `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `est_dog_size`, `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`, `confidence`, `intensity`
- Schema generates two files per analysis day: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` and `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json`

**Data Integration Strategy** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- PDF service will read data directly from `ViolationDatabase` using unified models
- `ViolationReport` model is now presentation-layer object, generated on-the-fly from raw `Violation` data
- Bark intensity data available from `PersistedBarkEvent.intensity` field

### Component Specifications
**New PDF Generation Component** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- Location: `bark_detector/utils/pdf_generator.py` (following reporting layer pattern)
- Integration: Will be consumed by `bark_detector/utils/report_generator.py` for PDF output
- Data Source: Reads exclusively from `ViolationDatabase` via unified data models
- Dependencies: Will add PDF generation library (reportlab or similar) to tech stack

**Component Interaction** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- CLI → Reporter → PDFGenerator → PDF File output
- PDFGenerator → ViolationDatabase (for violation and event data)
- Reporter will orchestrate PDF generation and file saving

### PDF Layout Specifications
- Note: items in curly brackets {} are additional instructions about what should go in the report. E.g. 
{Visual Graph of Barking Session} should be replaced with a visual graph of the bark events as described.

</Barking Violation Details Template>

Notes on Visual Graph for details template:
- X-axis is time with X=0 being the start time of the violation (in this case 06:25:13)
- The x-axis should stretch slightly past the end time of the violation (in this case 06:47:23)}
- The x-axis should be scaled to fit the width of a letter sized pdf.
- The y-axis shows bark intensity levels between 0 and 1

### File Naming Convensions
- Generated PDFs should combine the summary page and all violation details pages into one pdf document.
- Generated PDF naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD_Violation_Report.pdf`

### File Locations
**Source Tree Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- New PDF generator: `bark_detector/utils/pdf_generator.py`
- Integration point: `bark_detector/utils/report_generator.py` (existing)
- Test location: `tests/test_utils/` for PDF generation tests
- Output location: `reports/<date>/` directory for generated PDF files
- Data sources: `violations/<date>/` containing JSON files

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- PDF generation tests: `tests/test_utils/` (alongside existing report_generator tests)
- Integration tests: `tests/test_integration/` for CLI-level PDF generation
- Fixture data: `tests/fixtures/` for test violation data

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Run `uv run pytest` locally before publishing changes
- Use fixture data or trimmed real-world JSON samples from `violations/` directory
- Include CLI smoke tests for PDF generation features
- Mock PDF library dependencies for faster test execution
- Target high-value coverage prioritizing PDF generation and error handling paths

### Technical Constraints
**Evidence Preservation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- PDF generation must preserve integrity of violation evidence (timestamps, ordering, confidence scores)
- Analysis pipelines must produce repeatable results across different machines
- PDF output must maintain backward compatibility with existing violation data

**Python Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use dataclasses for PDF configuration and structured data
- Prefer type hints on public functions
- Handle filesystem paths with `pathlib.Path`
- Route messages through configured logging instance
- Execute through `uv run` for dependency management

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Primary language: Python 3.11.4 (supports >=3.9,<3.12)
- New dependency: PDF generation library (reportlab, fpdf, or weasyprint)
- Graph generation: Consider matplotlib or similar for bark intensity visualizations
- Package management: `uv` for all dependency installation and execution

### Project Structure Notes
The PDF generation service aligns well with the existing architecture, extending the utilities layer alongside `report_generator.py`. The service will integrate cleanly with the unified data models from Story 3.1 and prepare for CLI integration in Story 3.3.

## Testing
**Test Location**: `tests/test_utils/`
**Test Standards**:
- Use pytest framework with `uv run pytest` execution
- Focus on PDF generation, graph rendering, and error handling paths
- Mock PDF library for faster test execution and consistent output validation
- Use fixture data from `tests/fixtures/` or real-world JSON samples from `violations/`
**Testing Requirements**:
- Verify PDF generation with various violation scenarios (single violations, multiple violations, edge cases)
- Test graph generation with complete intensity data and missing/incomplete data
- Validate error handling for invalid violation data and file system issues
- Ensure PDF output format consistency and readability across different input data sets

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** PDF generation operates on local data with no external API calls. File system operations properly use Path objects and create directories securely. All user inputs (violation data) come from trusted internal data models.

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance characteristics:**
- Matplotlib backend configured for server environments (Agg backend)
- Memory-efficient BytesIO for graph generation
- Proper resource cleanup with plt.close() calls
- Large dataset testing confirms <30 second generation time for 50+ bark events
- PDF file sizes reasonable (~50KB for realistic datasets, >10KB for large datasets)
