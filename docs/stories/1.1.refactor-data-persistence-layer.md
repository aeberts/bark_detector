# Story 1.1: Refactor Data Persistence Layer

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system maintainer,
**I want** the `ViolationDatabase` module to read from and write to a date-partitioned folder structure,
**so that** violation and event data is stored in a robust, portable, and easily managed format.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `ViolationDatabase` class can correctly save `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` and `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json` files to a `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` directory.
2. The class can correctly load data from this new structure.
3. **The `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/features.md` are updated to reflect the new data persistence strategy.**

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Implement New Data Models** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `PersistedBarkEvent` model with schema: `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `est_dog_size` (nullable), `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`, `confidence`, `intensity`
  - [x] Create `Violation` model with schema: `violation_id`, `violation_type`, `violation_date`, `violation_start_time`, `violation_end_time`, `bark_event_ids` (array)
  - [x] Add JSON serialization/deserialization methods for both models

- [x] **Task 2: Refactor ViolationDatabase File Structure Methods** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement `save_events()` method to write `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` files to `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` directory
  - [x] Implement `save_violations_new()` method to write `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json` files to `violations/[YYYY-MM-DD]/` directory  
  - [x] Implement `load_events()` method to read from date-partitioned structure
  - [x] Implement `load_violations_new()` method to read from date-partitioned structure
  - [x] Create directory structure automatically when saving files

- [x] **Task 3: Maintain Backward Compatibility** (Integration Verification: 1)
  - [x] Ensure existing unit tests for ViolationDatabase unrelated to file paths still pass
  - [x] Test dual-mode support (legacy single-file vs new date-based structure)
  - [x] Verify existing API contracts remain functional

- [x] **Task 4: Update Documentation** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with summary of new data persistence strategy
  - [x] Update `docs/features.md` to reflect the new date-partitioned storage approach
  - [x] Document the new JSON file schemas and directory structure

- [x] **Task 5: Unit Testing**
  - [x] Write unit tests for `PersistedBarkEvent` model serialization/deserialization
  - [x] Write unit tests for `Violation` model serialization/deserialization
  - [x] Write unit tests for `save_events()` and `load_events()` methods
  - [x] Write unit tests for `save_violations_new()` and `load_violations_new()` methods
  - [x] Write unit tests for directory creation and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#new-data-models]

**PersistedBarkEvent Model:**
- **Purpose**: Raw, persistent log of every individual bark event detected during analysis, decoupled from violation interpretation
- **Integration**: Schema for records in `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` files
- **Key Attributes**: `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `est_dog_size` (nullable for future use), `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`, `confidence`, `intensity`

**Violation Model:**
- **Purpose**: Separate raw analysis results from final formatted `ViolationReport` for debugging/filtering flexibility
- **Integration**: Schema for records in `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json` files  
- **Key Attributes**: `violation_id`, `violation_type`, `violation_date`, `violation_start_time`, `violation_end_time`, `bark_event_ids` (array of bark_id references)

### Schema Integration Strategy
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
- **New Files**: System generates two files per day: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_events.json` and `[YYYY-MM-DD]_violations.json`
- **Refactored Model**: Existing `ViolationReport` becomes presentation-layer object generated from raw `Violation` data
- **Migration Strategy**: Post-deployment task to run `--analyze-violations` for historical dates to back-populate structure

### File Locations
[Source: Current project structure analysis]
- **Target File**: `bark_detector/legal/database.py` (existing ViolationDatabase class)
- **Model Location**: Create new models in `bark_detector/legal/models.py` or add to existing models file
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_legal/test_date_based_database.py` (existing test file to extend)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Language**: Python 3.11.4 - no version change required
- **Package Manager**: Must use `uv run ...` for all commands
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-mock >=7.0.0 for expanded test suite
- **Data Format**: JSON for file persistence (existing pattern)

### Component Integration
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#modified-components]
- **ViolationDatabase** (`bark_detector/legal/database.py`): Enhanced to manage read/write operations for new `_events.json` and `_violations.json` files
- **Integration Point**: Must work with `LegalViolationTracker` for saving analysis results

### Compatibility Requirements
[Source: Current codebase analysis]
- **Existing API**: Current ViolationDatabase initialization patterns must remain functional
- **Dual Mode**: Support both legacy single-file structure and new date-based structure
- **Current Implementation**: Already has `use_date_structure` flag and dual-mode support partially implemented

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **Framework**: pytest, pytest-mock >=7.0.0
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_legal/` directory for legal module tests
- **Pattern**: Expand existing `test_date_based_database.py` file
- **Integration Requirement**: New tests must validate bug fixes and new data persistence logic
- **Coverage**: Unit tests for all new model methods and file operations

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test JSON serialization/deserialization for both new models
- Test directory creation and file path handling
- Test error handling for missing directories and corrupted files
- Test backward compatibility with existing ViolationDatabase usage patterns
- Integration verification: existing unit tests unrelated to file paths must continue to pass
