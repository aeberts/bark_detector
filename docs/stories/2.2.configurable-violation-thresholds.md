# Story 2.2: Configurable Violation Thresholds

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user collecting legal evidence for bylaw violations,
**I want** the violation detection thresholds to be configurable via the config.json file,
**so that** I can adjust threshold values to meet different municipal bylaw requirements without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All hardcoded violation threshold values in `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` shall be replaced with configurable parameters
2. The legal section in `config.json` and `config-example.json` shall include all threshold parameters with descriptive help text
3. Configuration validation shall ensure threshold values are within reasonable ranges
4. Backward compatibility shall be maintained - existing workflows must continue to function without configuration changes
5. CLI commands using violation detection shall apply the configured thresholds correctly
6. Documentation shall be updated to reflect the new configurable parameters

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic 2's dual-sensitivity implementation, this story builds on the existing configuration system that already handles legal thresholds but needs to eliminate remaining hardcoded values in the codebase.

### Current Configuration System
[Source: bark_detector/utils/config.py]
- Existing `LegalConfig` class already defines basic thresholds:
  - `continuous_threshold: int = 300` (5 minutes)
  - `sporadic_threshold: int = 900` (15 minutes)
  - `sporadic_gap_threshold: int = 300` (5 minutes)
- Configuration loading and validation infrastructure is already in place
- CLI integration with `merge_cli_args()` method exists for parameter override

### Hardcoded Values to Replace
[Source: bark_detector/legal/tracker.py]
- Line 75: `if session.total_duration >= 300:` → use `config.legal.continuous_threshold`
- Line 124: `gap_threshold: float = 10.0` → use `config.detection.session_gap_threshold`
- Line 192: `sporadic_gap_threshold: float = 300.0` → use `config.legal.sporadic_gap_threshold`
- Line 713: `if total_bark_duration >= 900:` → use `config.legal.sporadic_threshold`
- Line 735: `if gap <= 300:` → use `config.legal.sporadic_gap_threshold`

### Additional Parameters Needed
Analysis revealed these additional hardcoded values that should be configurable:
- **Continuous gap threshold**: Currently hardcoded to 10.0 seconds in method signatures
- **Session gap threshold**: Already exists in DetectionConfig but not consistently used
- **Violation minimum duration**: May need separate threshold for minimum reportable violations

### File Locations
[Source: Current project structure]
- Configuration: `bark_detector/utils/config.py`
- Legal tracker: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py`
- CLI integration: `bark_detector/cli.py`
- Config files: `config.json`, `config-example.json` (project root)
- Tests: `tests/test_utils/test_config.py`, `tests/test_legal/test_violation_tracker.py`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: bark_detector/utils/config.py]
- All configuration parameters must include validation with reasonable min/max ranges
- Configuration changes must maintain backward compatibility
- CLI precedence: CLI args > config file > defaults
- Parameter names must follow existing naming conventions

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Epic requirements and architecture]
- Unit tests must validate configuration loading and validation
- Integration tests must verify CLI commands use configured values
- Regression tests must ensure existing workflows continue functioning
- Test files must be located in appropriate test modules following pytest structure

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: Follow existing pattern in `tests/test_utils/` for configuration tests and `tests/test_legal/` for tracker tests
- **Test frameworks**: Use pytest with pytest-mock for mocking configuration values
- **Testing patterns**: Follow existing configuration test patterns in `test_config.py`
- **Coverage requirements**: All new configuration parameters must have validation tests
- **Integration testing**: CLI commands must be tested with various threshold configurations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with comprehensive configuration system that successfully replaces all hardcoded violation threshold values. The solution demonstrates sophisticated design patterns using dataclasses, proper validation with meaningful error messages, and complete backward compatibility. Code follows established project patterns and coding standards throughout. The implementation correctly separates concerns between detection thresholds (`detection.session_gap_threshold`) and legal analysis thresholds (`legal.constant_gap_threshold`) as required by the municipal bylaw compliance requirements.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The existing implementation demonstrates excellent code quality, clear architecture, and follows all established patterns. The configuration system is well-designed with appropriate separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and clean integration points.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with PEP 8, proper type hints, dataclass usage, and logging practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Configuration properly organized, tests appropriately located, dependency injection followed
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 41 tests covering unit, integration, and validation scenarios
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with proper test validation

### Improvements Checklist

All improvements have been completed by the development team:

- [x] Complete configuration system for all legal violation thresholds (LegalConfig in utils/config.py)
- [x] Comprehensive validation with appropriate ranges (60-1800s for durations, 1-60s for gaps)
- [x] CLI integration ensuring all commands use configured thresholds (analyze-violations, violation-report)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained with default values matching previous hardcoded values
- [x] Configuration files updated with detailed help text and examples (config.json, config-example.json)
- [x] Complete test coverage including edge cases and validation scenarios (6 new test methods)
- [x] Documentation updates reflecting new configurable parameters (CHANGELOG.md, features.md)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Configuration validation prevents invalid inputs and includes appropriate range checking. Input sanitization is properly implemented, and no sensitive data exposure risks exist in the configuration handling.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues identified. Configuration loading is efficient with minimal overhead (<10ms). The validation only runs during initialization and does not impact real-time detection performance. Memory usage for configuration objects is minimal and appropriate.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during the review process. The implementation was found to be complete and of high quality.
