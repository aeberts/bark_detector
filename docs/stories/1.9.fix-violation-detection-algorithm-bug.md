# Story 1.9: Fix Violation Detection Algorithm Bug

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user collecting legal evidence for bylaw violations,
**I want** the violation detection system to correctly identify violations when they occur,
**so that** I don't get 0 violations reported when clear legal violations are happening in my audio recordings.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Continuous Violation Detection Using Start Timestamp Intervals
**Given** a sequence of bark events with their start timestamps
**When** the time gap between consecutive bark event start timestamps is less than 10 seconds
**Then** the system treats them as part of the same continuous barking session and triggers a violation when the session duration (latest start timestamp - first start timestamp) reaches 5+ minutes

### AC2: Sporadic Violation Detection Using Start Timestamp Intervals
**Given** a sequence of bark events with their start timestamps
**When** the time gap between consecutive bark event start timestamps is less than 5 minutes
**Then** the system treats them as part of the same sporadic barking session and triggers a violation when the session duration (latest start timestamp - first start timestamp) reaches 15+ minutes

### AC3: Algorithm Input Data Model Implementation
**Given** the formal algorithm requirements from `docs/architecture/violation_detection_algorithm.md`
**When** violation detection is performed
**Then** the system creates `AlgorithmInputEvent` objects with proper `startTimestamp` in ISO 8601 format from the raw `_events.json` data

### AC4: Enhanced Violation Output Data Model Implementation
**Given** detected violations using the formal algorithm
**When** violations are created
**Then** the system produces `Violation` objects with proper `type`, `startTimestamp`, `violationTriggerTimestamp`, `endTimestamp`, `durationMinutes`, `violationDurationMinutes`, and `barkEventIds` (as array) fields as specified in the enhanced architecture

### AC5: Zero False Negatives for Clear Violations
**Given** audio recordings that clearly contain legal violations per City of Kelowna bylaws
**When** the new algorithm is applied
**Then** the system detects the violations instead of returning 0 violations

### AC6: Prevent Duplicate Violations Within Same Type During Session Processing
**Given** an ongoing violation session that has already triggered a violation of a specific type (Continuous or Sporadic)
**When** subsequent bark events continue to extend the same session
**Then** the system does not create additional violation records of the same type for the ongoing session, while still allowing detection of both Continuous and Sporadic violation types for the same incident if it qualifies for both

## Dev Notes

### Bug Context
**CRITICAL BUG**: The existing violation detection system in `LegalViolationTracker` incorrectly measures cumulative bark audio duration instead of sustained barking activity duration. This fundamental algorithmic error causes 0 violations to be detected even when clear legal violations are occurring according to City of Kelowna bylaws.

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.8, the hybrid architecture successfully separates recording management (using BarkingSessions with 10s gaps) from violation analysis (direct event processing). The violation detection methods `_analyze_continuous_violations_from_events()` and `_analyze_sporadic_violations_from_events()` already exist but contain the algorithmic bug that needs to be fixed.

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md + violation_detection_algorithm.md]
- **PersistedBarkEvent**: Contains `realworld_date`, `realworld_time`, `bark_id`, `bark_type`, `confidence`, `intensity`, `audio_file_name`, `bark_audiofile_timestamp`
- **Enhanced Violation Model**: Must be updated to include:
  - `startTimestamp`: Legal compliance - when barking incident began
  - `violationTriggerTimestamp`: System audit - when violation was detected
  - `endTimestamp`: Legal compliance - when barking incident actually ended
  - `durationMinutes`: Total incident duration for legal evidence
  - `violationDurationMinutes`: Duration from trigger to end for analytics
  - `barkEventIds`: Array of UUID strings (not concatenated string)

### Algorithm Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/violation_detection_algorithm.md]
- **AlgorithmInputEvent**: Must have `id` (from bark_id) and `startTimestamp` in ISO 8601 format
- **Continuous Algorithm**: 10-second max gap, 5-minute minimum session duration
- **Sporadic Algorithm**: 5-minute max gap, 15-minute minimum session duration
- **Critical Design**: All calculations based on start timestamp intervals, NOT cumulative audio duration
- **Enhanced Violation Creation**: Violations must be updated as sessions continue beyond trigger point to capture accurate `endTimestamp` and complete `barkEventIds` arrays
- **Three Timestamp Architecture**: Provides complete temporal boundaries for legal evidence collection

### Violation Rules
[Source: docs/violation_rules.md]
- Continuous Violation: 5+ minutes of sustained barking with gaps ≤10 seconds between start timestamps
- Sporadic Violation: 15+ minutes of intermittent barking with gaps ≤5 minutes between start timestamps
- Core Principle: "All rules are based on the time elapsed between the start timestamps of consecutive bark events"

### File Locations (Existing Files to Fix)
- **Primary Bug Location**: `bark_detector/legal/tracker.py` - Contains broken `_analyze_continuous_violations_from_events()` and `_analyze_sporadic_violations_from_events()` methods

- **Test Files**: `tests/test_legal/test_violation_tracker.py` - Existing tests that need updates for fixed algorithm
