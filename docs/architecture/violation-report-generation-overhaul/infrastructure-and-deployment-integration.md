# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure

Your current deployment foundation provides excellent support for the PDF enhancement:

**Current Deployment:**
- Cross-platform Python via `uv` package manager with intelligent platform detection
- Platform-specific dependency management through `install.py` script
- Development on Apple Silicon, deployment to Intel Mac production environment

**Infrastructure Tools:**
- `uv` for dependency resolution and virtual environment management
- `install.py` for automated platform-aware TensorFlow and audio library installation
- Git-based source synchronization between development and deployment environments

**Environments:**
- **Development:** Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3) with full development toolchain
- **Production:** Intel Mac mini-class device for continuous bark monitoring
- **Testing:** Both platforms supported via comprehensive pytest suite (204 tests)

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Leverage existing `install.py` infrastructure with minimal PDF-specific additions

**Dependency Integration:**
```python
# Enhanced install.py additions (minimal changes)
PDF_DEPENDENCIES = [
    "reportlab>=4.0.4",
    "matplotlib>=3.7.2",
    "pillow>=10.0.0"  # matplotlib dependency
]

def install_pdf_dependencies():
    """Install PDF generation dependencies via uv"""
    for dep in PDF_DEPENDENCIES:
        run_uv_command(f"add {dep}")
```

**Infrastructure Changes:**
**New Directory Creation:**
```python
# Enhanced directory structure creation in install.py
def ensure_directory_structure():
    directories = [
        "recordings",
        "violations",
        "reports",      # Enhanced: PDF output directory
        "logs"
    ]
    for dir_name in directories:
        Path(dir_name).mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

## Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Git-based rollback with dependency cleanup

**Automated Rollback Process:**
```bash
# 1. Git rollback to previous stable version
git checkout previous-stable-tag

# 2. Dependency cleanup (if needed)
uv sync  # Automatically removes unused dependencies

# 3. Verify system functionality
uv run python -m bark_detector --violation-report 2025-09-15
# Falls back to text-based reporting automatically
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Feature flags** - PDF generation can be disabled via configuration without code rollback
- **Graceful degradation** - PDF generation failures automatically fall back to existing text reports
- **Zero data risk** - PDF enhancement only reads existing data, never modifies violation databases

**Monitoring:**
- **Existing logging infrastructure** - PDF generation integrates with established logging patterns
- **Error tracking** - PDF generation errors logged alongside existing CLI command errors
- **Performance monitoring** - PDF generation timing logged for performance regression detection
