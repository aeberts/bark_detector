## Risk Assessment

**TOP 3 RISKS:**

1. **MEDIUM:** **PDF Generation Performance** - Large violation datasets may impact report generation time
   - *Mitigation:* Implement performance monitoring and optional background processing

2. **MEDIUM:** **Cross-Platform PDF Consistency** - Ensure identical PDF output on Apple Silicon vs Intel Mac
   - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive cross-platform testing in existing test suite

3. **LOW:** **Legal Evidence Quality Validation** - PDF reports require manual review for legal compliance
   - *Mitigation:* Implement automated PDF content validation and manual review workflow

## Final Assessment

**ARCHITECTURE APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION** ✅

This brownfield enhancement architecture demonstrates exceptional design quality, seamlessly integrating PDF generation capabilities with the existing bark detector infrastructure. The approach of leveraging established patterns, preserving data models, and providing comprehensive error handling creates a robust foundation for reliable legal evidence generation.
