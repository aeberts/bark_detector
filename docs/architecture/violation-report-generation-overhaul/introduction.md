# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Bark Detector with a complete violation report generation overhaul, replacing the deprecated LogBasedReportGenerator with a robust PDF generation system. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of Epic 1 while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining how new PDF generation components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing project structure and architecture:

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** ML-based bark detection system for legal evidence collection against Regional District of Central Okanagan (RDCO) and City of Kelowna noise bylaws
- **Current Tech Stack:** Python 3.11.4, YAMNet/TensorFlow Hub, UV package manager, pytest testing framework
- **Architecture Style:** Modular Python package (bark_detector/) with distinct core/, legal/, utils/, recording/ modules
- **Deployment Method:** Cross-platform support via install.py with platform-specific dependency management

**Available Documentation:**
- Complete architecture documentation in docs/architecture/ with established tech-stack.md, source-tree.md, coding-standards.md
- Existing violation report generation analysis identifying LogBasedReportGenerator as brittle and deprecated
- Comprehensive BMAD project structure with PRDs, stories, and QA assessments

**Critical Architectural Constraints:**
- Must maintain CLI interface compatibility (--violation-report command signature)
- Must preserve existing JSON data persistence structure (violations/YYYY-MM-DD/ format)
- Cannot introduce significant performance degradation for legal evidence processing
- Must respect existing data models (PersistedBarkEvent, Violation, ViolationReport) for continuity

**Integration Points Identified:**
- **Existing LogBasedReportGenerator** (510 lines) - marked for complete replacement, has complex data model duplication
- **ViolationDatabase** - robust foundation with dual-mode support (legacy + date-partitioned)
- **Legal data models** - well-defined PersistedBarkEvent, Violation, ViolationReport schemas already in place
- **CLI orchestration** - established pattern in cli.py for command routing and error handling
