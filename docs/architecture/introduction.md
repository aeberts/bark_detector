# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Bark Detector with a refactored violation reporting system. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of this new feature while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system. This document is based on the provided `prd.md` and my prior analysis of the codebase.

## Existing Project Analysis

  * **Current Project State**: The project is a modular Python 3.11 application using the YAMNet ML model for real-time bark detection. It is designed to run on both Intel and Apple Silicon macOS platforms. The core problem, as identified in the PRD, is the unreliability of its two conflicting violation reporting features, which undermines the project's primary goal of legal evidence collection.
  * **Available Documentation**: This architecture is informed by the PRD and a prior brownfield analysis document. These documents cover the existing tech stack, source tree organization, and known technical debt.
  * **Identified Constraints**: The new architecture must remain compatible with the existing CLI structure, core data models (`BarkEvent`, `BarkingSession`), and the platform-specific `install.py` script. The solution must not introduce significant performance degradation.
