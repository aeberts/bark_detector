# Epic 2: Detection Accuracy Improvements

**Epic Goal**: To enhance the bark detection system's accuracy and completeness for legal evidence collection by implementing dual sensitivity modes that optimize for different use cases (real-time recording efficiency vs. comprehensive analysis completeness).

**Integration Requirements**: The enhanced detection system must maintain full backward compatibility with existing workflows while providing configurable sensitivity settings. Must integrate seamlessly with Epic 1's ViolationDatabase persistence system and maintain all existing CLI command functionality.

## Story 2.1: Implement Dual-Sensitivity Bark Detection for Enhanced Analysis Accuracy
* **As a** user collecting legal evidence for bylaw violations,
    **I want** the analysis mode to use enhanced sensitivity settings to capture all bark events,
    **so that** I can ensure comprehensive violation documentation without missing legitimate bark incidents.
* **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. The system shall support separate sensitivity settings for real-time recording triggers vs. post-analysis detection
    2. Analysis mode (`--analyze-violations`) shall use configurable lower sensitivity (default 0.30) to maximize bark event capture
    3. Real-time recording mode shall maintain current sensitivity (0.68) to prevent false positive recordings
    4. Configuration system shall support both `sensitivity` and `analysis_sensitivity` parameters
    5. CLI commands shall maintain full backward compatibility with existing workflows
    6. Enhanced detection shall demonstrate measurable improvement in bark capture rates (target: 50%+ increase in test cases)
* **Integration Verification**:
    1. Enhanced detection must integrate seamlessly with Epic 1's ViolationDatabase persistence system
    2. All existing workflows must continue functioning without modification
    3. Performance must remain acceptable with enhanced sensitivity analysis
