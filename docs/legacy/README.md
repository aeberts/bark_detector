These documents were archived during BMad Method integration to resolve documentation coherence conflicts. The Bark Detector project now uses:

- **Epic-Driven Development**: Stories managed in `docs/stories/`
- **BMad Templates**: Professional templates in `.bmad-core/templates/`
- **Agent Workflows**: Specialized agents for SM, Dev, QA roles
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` as primary technical reference

## Historical Value

These documents contain valuable project history and may be referenced for understanding evolution of requirements and technical decisions. For current development, always use BMad Method workflows and templates.
