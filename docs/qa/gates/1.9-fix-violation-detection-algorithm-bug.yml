# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.9

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "1.9"
story_title: "Fix Violation Detection Algorithm Bug"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Persisted-event workflow is functional, but violation reports include duplicate audio paths and the new fallback path lacks automated regression coverage."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)"
updated: "2025-09-22T08:45:00Z"

    title: "Duplicate audio paths in violation evidence"
    severity: medium
    description: "_infer_recording_paths_from_events adds both fully-qualified and bare filenames when the same recording is referenced repeatedly, cluttering legal evidence output (bark_detector/legal/tracker.py:333)."

    title: "Missing automated regression for events-only analysis path"
    severity: medium
    description: "The persisted-events fallback is validated manually but lacks a dedicated integration test in tests/test_legal/test_violation_tracker.py, leaving the regression hardening unprotected."
