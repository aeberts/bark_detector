Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 10
- **Critical Risks**: 0
- **High Risks**: 3
- **Risk Score**: 56/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Priority Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Filename Format Inconsistency

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Bug already discovered in current implementation
**Impact**: Medium - Will cause downstream reporting failures and user confusion
**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate**: Fix `_get_violations_file_path()` method (one-character change)
- **Verification**: Unit tests for both events and violations filename consistency
- **Integration**: End-to-end test with file creation validation
**Testing Focus**:
- Direct method testing for underscore format
- Cross-validation of consistent naming
- Integration tests verifying corrected files are created

### 2. DATA-001: JSON File Corruption During Persistence

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex persistence operations with file system interaction
**Impact**: High - Could corrupt legal evidence data
**Mitigation**:
- **Preventive**: Atomic file operations with temporary files
- **Detective**: JSON schema validation after write operations
- **Corrective**: Backup previous versions before overwrite
**Testing Focus**:
- Integration tests for file write operations
- Error injection testing for disk space/permission failures
- Schema validation testing for malformed JSON prevention

### 3. BUS-001: Legal Evidence Generation Workflow Disruption

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Changes to core violation analysis workflow
**Impact**: High - Disrupts critical legal evidence collection process
**Mitigation**:
- **Preventive**: Comprehensive integration testing with real audio samples
- **Detective**: End-to-end workflow validation before deployment
- **Corrective**: Rollback plan to previous working implementation
**Testing Focus**:
- Complete user journey testing with sample data
- Regression testing against known good outputs
- Performance testing to ensure no workflow slowdown

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Required)

**TECH-001 Mitigation Tests:**
- `1.3-UNIT-001`: Direct filename format validation
- `1.3-UNIT-002`: Consistent naming across both file types
- `1.3-INT-001`: Integration test for corrected file creation

**DATA-001 Mitigation Tests:**
- `1.3-INT-002`: JSON schema compliance validation
- `1.3-INT-004`: File write error handling and recovery
- Error injection tests for disk space/permission failures

**BUS-001 Mitigation Tests:**
- `1.3-E2E-001`: Complete legal evidence workflow validation
- `1.3-E2E-002`: Error scenario testing with real audio
- Performance regression testing

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**TECH-002 Mitigation:**
- CLI integration testing with mocked components
- Backward compatibility validation

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests

- Documentation validation
- Edge case scenario testing
- Performance monitoring setup

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Filename format inconsistency (blocking for all downstream features)
- **DATA-001**: File corruption prevention (critical for legal evidence integrity)
- **BUS-001**: Legal workflow validation (core business functionality)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-002**: CLI integration issues (can be addressed with monitoring)
- **DATA-002**: Data loss (acceptable with backup strategy)

### Accepted Risks

- **BUS-002**: Minor user workflow changes (acceptable with documentation)
- **OPS-001**: Test suite complexity (manageable with good practices)
- **OPS-002**: Documentation gaps (can be addressed post-deployment)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Performance Metrics:**
- JSON file write operation latency
- CLI command execution time
- Violation analysis processing time

**Error Rates:**
- File creation failure rates
- JSON schema validation failures
- CLI command error rates

**Business KPIs:**
- Legal evidence generation success rate
- User workflow completion rate
- File consistency validation pass rate

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Any test failures occur during implementation
- Performance degradation detected in CI/CD pipeline
- User reports workflow issues
- Additional integration points discovered
- Schema changes required for PersistedBarkEvent/Violation models

## Risk-Based Gate Decision

**Gate Mapping:**
- 3 High risks (score 6) → **CONCERNS**
- No critical risks (score 9) → Not FAIL
- Comprehensive mitigation strategies in place
- Strong test coverage for high-risk areas

**Recommended Gate Status: CONCERNS**
- Requires: Completion of high-risk mitigation tests
- Monitoring: File creation consistency and JSON integrity
- Rollback: Previous working violation analysis implementation ready
