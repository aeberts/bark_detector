# Session Restart Checklist

## Getting Back on Track (5-Step Process)

### 1. **Check Current State**
- Read `@docs/project_status.md` for project phase and active features
- Review recent git commits to understand latest changes

### 2. **Understand Priorities** 
- Check `@docs/backlog.md` for current tasks and their status
- Identify any blocking issues in `@docs/bugs.md`

### 3. **Restore Context**
- If user asks about specific feature: Read `@docs/features.md` for requirements
- If starting new work: Use appropriate template from `@docs/templates/`

### 4. **Verify Environment**
- Confirm working directory and git status
- Check if any tests or builds need to be run

### 5. **Clarify Next Steps**
- Ask user to confirm current priorities if unclear
- Propose specific next actions based on backlog status
