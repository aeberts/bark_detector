# Bark Detector - Product Requirements Document

This project aims to develop a simple "bark detector" which will identify the sound of one or more barking dogs and will start making a medium-quality sound recording of the barking.

- The system will use a simple "decibel threashold" approach to detect barking (no machine learning will be done on the device).
- The system will continue recording until 30 seconds pass without sounds occuring above the decibel threashold.
